samsung_initramfs-tools
=======================

A collection of tools used to create kernels for Sumsung devices from the Galaxy Tab (P1x) to the entire line of Galaxy S III devices
and everything in between. Early tolls seem to work on early Galaxy devices that use initramfs up to the Galaxy Attain which is an
obscure device, so if you have trouble with the late model repack.sh try this one instead. The others are a bit more self explanitory.
If you have questions find me on IRC #teameos #team-troll #evervolv #oudhitsquad or jkirk777@gmail.com

None of these tools was creted by me. I may have modified one to work on another device, but otherwise someone else wrote them. All I
am trying to do is put them all in one place for newer users to find and experiment with while learning. Thanks to SuperCurio, Mistadman
Xioulu sp. for their work on these tools. enjoy. interloper
